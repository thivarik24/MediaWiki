Good Morning Team,


MEDIAWIKI PROBLEM STATEMENT

We want to automate the deployment of MediaWiki using.

1. Kubernetes with Helm Chart/ any equivalent automation with its own Dockerfiles for application and database.
2. Terraform or any IaC tool with any Configuration Management tool integrated.
 

Choose only one of your comfort.
The above automation should support CI/CD practices of chosen deployment styles like Rolling Update or BlueGreen Deployment. (Optional)
(No Docker compose)
We want to assess your learnability and your current knowledge of config management systems.
