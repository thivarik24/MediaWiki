Good Morning Team,


MEDIAWIKI PROBLEM STATEMENT

We want to automate the deployment of MediaWiki using.

1. Kubernetes with Helm Chart/ any equivalent automation with its own Dockerfiles for application and database.
2. Terraform or any IaC tool with any Configuration Management tool integrated.
 

Choose only one of your comfort.
The above automation should support CI/CD practices of chosen deployment styles like Rolling Update or BlueGreen Deployment. (Optional)
(No Docker compose)
We want to assess your learnability and your current knowledge of config management systems.


-------------------------------------------------------I have chosen the 1st one------------------------------------------------------

Here, I did a step-by-step Process. for MediaWiki application downloading the Manual Installations. 
What happend is that I did upto the Kubernetes config file aned Deployment file. I used Third party VM's (EC2)AWS, Unfortunately THE ACCOUNT HAS SUSPENDED.
I Will Attach a screenshots upto now, and I'll try to do in a Different 
VM's like GCP cluster, because account has been suspended I am unable to do the next steps.
